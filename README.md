# "Login with Facebook" button in React

This is a library that provieds a button you can use to integrate facebook login into your react app. The reason I wrote this one is because I found to the two alternatives to a) have poor typing that resulted in me having to write my own ad hoc or b) shipped with a bunch of other features I didn't need.

_Note: To use the Facebook login API, you need to get an App ID from [here](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/) and enable the Login Javascript API._

## Demo
